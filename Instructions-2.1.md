1. Write a program to read an array of integers (with max size 10) and print the total number of even numbers and odd numbers in that array.
At the time of execution, the program should print the message on the console as:

Enter array size: 
For example, if the user gives the input as:
Enter array size: 4
Next, the program should print the message on the console as:
Enter 4 elements: 
If the user gives the input as:
Enter 4 elements : 23 45 22 61
then the program should print the result as:
Total number of even numbers in the array : 1
Total number of odd numbers in the array : 3
